# First App With Python

## Overview
When I started learning Python, I wanted to be able to share my work with others, both coders and non-coders, and have them test out my code. 
However, it was a problem for non-coders to run my code and see the output.

So I decided to create an app that non_coders can easily navigate to see how my code works

## How The App Works
The app was made with PyQt5 and the code is a simple guessing game which makes use of exceptions to print out different ouputs depending on the accuracy of the guess of the user.
First, the user inputs a _lucky_ number according to prompt. 
If the input number is same as the stored _lucky_ number, the user wins! Else the user is told to try again.
If the user enters a character that isn't an integer, the ValueError raised will ouput a prompt telling the user that teir input isn't a numbr

NOTE: the app is only at its first version
